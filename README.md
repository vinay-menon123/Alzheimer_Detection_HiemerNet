##Abstract
The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for the identification and categorization of Alzheimer's disease stages is thoroughly examined in this study.  Effective intervention and therapy depend on a prompt and correct diagnosis. This study uses modern image analysis techniques to extract significant characteristics from MRI scans and various image filters to segment the image better, concentrating on structural and functional anomalies linked with Alzheimer's progression.
The dataset consists of MRI scans from people with Alzheimer's disease at different stages, which have been classified according to clinical evaluations. Deep neural networks and other machine learning algorithms are used in the research to identify minute patterns that point to the advancement of the disease. Our accuracy has increased thanks to the HeimerNet CNN architecture that we have adopted. Techniques for feature selection are used to lower dimensionality and improve interpretability of the model. The suggested method seeks to both categorize the phases of Alzheimer's disease and further knowledge of the underlying neuroanatomical alterations connected to each stage.
To evaluate the created model's generalization abilities, it is validated on a separate dataset. The model's effectiveness in correctly identifying the phases of Alzheimer's disease is demonstrated by the results, which also highlight the model's potential as a useful tool for physicians in early diagnosis and individualized treatment planning. The study also explores how interpretable the model's predictions are, providing insight into the particular imaging biomarkers that are involved in the categorization.
The results of this study shed light on the combination of sophisticated image analysis and machine learning methods for MRI scan-based Alzheimer's disease staging and diagnosis. The suggested approach has the potential to improve clinical decision-making and support further attempts to create efficient therapies for Alzheimer's patients.
